# Voice_Activated_to_Image_Crearator
 Implemented an realtime application that generates images based on voice input using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. 

# Here is the Demo image of output for this system:

# The Project involved:
 Generative artificial intelligence (AI) describes algorithms that help in creating/generating new content, including audio, code, images, text and videos. 

-> In this repo, we build a real-time Voice-to-Image Generator using the concept of Generative AI. It is carried out in two steps:

# Voice-to-text conversion 
 The speech is captured in real-time through the microphone and converted to text using state-of-the-art Opensource AI models from OpenAI and Whisper libraries.
 
# Text to Image Generation
 The converted text is provided as input to the state-of-the-art Image Generation models like Dalle-2, and the image is thus generated.

# Deployment Information

 This repository helps you build your own AI based voice to image generation with OpenAI API & Gradio

# Getting the secret key to use OPENAI API

-> Get your OpenAI API key 
-> Signup on the OpenAI platform if not done already.
-> Replace that key in the code in the "voice-to-image-generation-dalle.ipynb" notebook.

@ Please keep the api key highly private and do not share with anyone.

-> If you face any access errors with , please check for the usage limits of your account, check the API keys limit and create another API key if possible. If not, try creating another account, create a new API key and utilize it.
